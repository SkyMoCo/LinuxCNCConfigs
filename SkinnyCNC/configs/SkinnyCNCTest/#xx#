I started to slog through it, but since this a simple and pretty inexpensive unit I am hoping I am not the first.  The manual was only slightly bigger than a postage stamp so I scanned the modbus sections.  I've worked with other modbus devices so I am not entirely new.  I have a modbus adapter and have it talking to the unit at least.
